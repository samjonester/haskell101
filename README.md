# Learn Me A Haskell

I'm reading through [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters), and I'd like to test some of ideas out in code. I'd also like to do haskell katas, so I need an environment to TDD haskell.

##Setup Steps
1. Install [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
2. Init a new project `cabal init`. The important settings I chose are a `library` with the source directory `src`.
3. Init a new sandbox `cabal sandbox init`.
